```
install.packages('Hmisc')
install.packages('ggplot2')

To reproduce all the figures in the manuscript (except example 2), once dependencies are installed, type:
```
setwd("<path-to-repo>/Code/")
source('plot.R')
```

Note that `<path-to-repo>` must be replaced with the path to your local copy of the repo.
